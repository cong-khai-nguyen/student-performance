# Description
This Machine Learning project that I did aims at using Linear Regression model to predict the students' final scores based on the students's first grade, second grade, studytime, number of failures, absences, workday and weekend alcohol consumption rate. Using the model, the project was able to predict correctly 95% of the testing data.
The data set can also be found at this link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance
